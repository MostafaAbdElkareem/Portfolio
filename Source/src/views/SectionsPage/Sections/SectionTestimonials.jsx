												I worked with Mostafa during the evangelism of education solutions,
												these type of solution requires a simplicity and sophistication at the
												same type to address the experience of a school teacher and a partner
												who is not a tech savvy and keep the student engaged and interactive
												with the tool. I was amazed by Mostafa ideas and suggestion and most of
												all his understanding to the user emotions and how they will feel in
												each scenario they cover which made him a great UX designer and an
												important asset in the project adding to that Mostafa has a
												sportsmanship, he is always open to ideas and receive critique with an
												open mind and a sense of humor while maintain a laser focused target. I
												would definitely recommend him in a leadership role.
